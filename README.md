     Regex Onboarding Hackathon
This is command line app made by Python. It extracts the following data types from any text files if there are matches. In addition, it validates the user input. So, you can either input file or check the matches in the file called "test_string.txt" that I wrote to check pattern. You just need to clone GitHub repo to have access to it. You can also insert any other file but it should exist in the computer and give it correct path.
Data types to extract or validate:
.Email addresses
.URLs
.Phone numbers
.Credit card numbers
.Time in 12-hour or 24-hour format
.HTML tags
.Currency amounts

Steps to run app:
1) Clone this repo(git clone url)
2) Run the code(Python3 regex.py)
3) Input your choice when prompted
Note: "test_string.txt" is the file I wrote that checks matches. 
If you want to check matches from, you can by inserting 3rd choice.
If you have your own file, you can also check the matches from it.
This app considers all real cases not only those which are written on Canvas.
