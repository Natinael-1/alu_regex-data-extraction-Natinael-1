This Python command line app checks matches, or validates user input such as email, url, 
phone number, credit card number, time, currency and html tags.
       steps to run app
1) Clone this repo
2) Run the code
3) Input your choice when prompted
Note: "test_string.txt" is the file I wrote that checks matches. 
If you want to check matches from, you can by inserting 3rd choice.
If you have your own file, you can also check the matches from it.
This app considers all real cases not only those which are written on Canvas.
